# SQL_for_Data_Analysis

1. The project involves exploring two tables: menu items and order details, to analyze customer preferences and menu performance. This analysis helps identify popular items and those that need improvement.
2. The first objective includes analyzing the menu items table, focusing on item counts, price ranges, and category distributions. This foundational step sets the stage for deeper customer behavior insights.
3. Using SQL commands like 'ORDER BY' allows users to sort menu items based on price, helping to quickly identify the least and most expensive dishes.
4. Aggregating data with 'GROUP BY' enables users to categorize menu items and count the number of dishes within each category effectively, enhancing menu analysis.
5. Calculating average prices in each category provides insights into pricing strategies, showing which categories are more expensive and which are more affordable.
6. Using SQL queries to find the date range of orders simplifies analysis. Employing MIN and MAX functions provides a quick way to assess the time span of data.
7. Counting unique orders versus total items reveals different insights about sales volume. This distinction is vital for inventory management and sales strategy development.
8. Using subqueries can enhance your queries by allowing you to perform operations on aggregated results.
9. Understanding the structure of the order details table is crucial for effective data analysis. This knowledge helps in executing accurate queries and interpreting results.
10. The HAVING clause is essential for filtering results based on aggregate functions after grouping data.

When I first started learning SQL, I thought it was just a structured version of the English language — simple, straightforward, and readable. But the deeper I dove in, the more I realized it's an ocean of logic, syntax, and powerful possibilities.

From basic queries to nested subqueries, aggregations, joins, and window functions — it's been a thrilling journey. At times, it's overwhelming. At times, it's empowering. But one thing is for sure — I’ve absolutely fallen in love with SQL.
What started as curiosity has now become a passion.
